# z-waif
Fully local &amp; open source AI Waifu. VTube Studio, Discord, Minecraft, custom made RAG (long term memory), alarm, and plenty more! Has a WebUI and hotkey shortcuts. All software is free (or extremely cheap)!

Reccomended Windows 10/11 and a CUDA (NVidia) GPU with atleast 16GB+ of VRAM.
Can now support Mac and Linux! Thanks [@cootshk](https://github.com/cootshk)!
Uses Oobabooga, RVC, and Whisper to run AI systems locally. Works as a front end to tie many programs together into one cohesive whole.

The goal of the project is less about giving an "all in one package", and moreso to give you the tools and knowledge for you to create your own AI Waifu!

Z-Waif has [a basic website](https://zwaif.neocities.org/) that you can visit. I have also set up [a small Discord](https://discord.gg/XDWsAyVasH) for community members to chat as well.

## Diaspora
#### The Original:
[TumblerWarren/Virtual_Avatar_ChatBot](https://github.com/TumblerWarren/Virtual_Avatar_ChatBot), this is the original project that this code is spun-off of. Full credit to that project - it provided the skeleton for the many advancements now in place. It has more of a focus on non-local AI, if that is what you need.
#### Branches & Versions:
[Drakkadakka/z-waif-experimental-](https://github.com/Drakkadakka/z-waif-experimental-), offers a few upgrades; namely Twitch chat & streaming support, as well as a few other enhancements.


## Recent Changelog

v1.8-R2

- Fixed a bug that would cause random crashes in faster-whisper.
	- Can now confirm no more crashes with it.
	- Done by setting "temperature" setting to "0.0"

---.---.---.---

v1.8

- whisper-turbo, a new ultra fast transcribing method
	- Optional, off by default
	- Roughly 4x as fast, with the same transcription quality!
	- Needs CUDA Toolkit and cuDNN downloaded to work with GPU
		- CUDA 12 (RTX 20 series+)
	- You can also toggle it to just use the CPU instead, at a hit to quality/speed.
	- WARNING: I have experienced random crashes with this, but it's likely due to low VRAM / improper install.

- Chunked audio transcription
	- Optional, on by default
	- Takes in your audio and processes it while you are still speaking.
	- Helps with response times. Reduces transcription quality slightly.
	- Configurable chunking amount, Lower = process more often. Default is fairly high.

- Mac support
	- Use the statup.sh script.
	- Thanks to @Cootshk!
	- May require tinkering to figure out.

- Fixed an issue where the first sentence said would cause a crash after that.
- Fixed an issue with numba and sympy importing things, despite not existing.
- Interruptible chats in Hangout Mode now work off their own audio file internally.

## To-Do

### üì∂ Enhancements
- [ ] Make the RAG/Long Term Memory be multiprocessed for better performance
- [X] Make the LLM input and TTS output streaming, to lower the "processing time"
- [ ] Figure out how to load LLAMA 3.2 Vision, for better multimodal, and no needed loader

### ü§ñ Improvements
- [ ] Give internal dialoguing for chain of thought / reasoning
- [ ] Emotional / Tone understanding
- [ ] Automatic gaming & real world interaction
- [ ] Use an integrated voice generation system, with the ability to modify the tone
- [ ] Long term experience-based summarizations of ideas and history (pull form experience)

### ü¶Ñ Imperium
- [ ] Create more Youtube tutorials and other related content
- [ ] Look more into optimal LLMs and configs
- [ ] Set up better Git and contribution methods
- [ ] Create a way for users to auto-update the program without having to hack files together
- [ ] Evangelize AI Waifus to the world!

## State of Development

The project could be considered in an "early access state". Some parts may be mildly buggy, janky, or obtuse. The project as a whole, however, is stable and reasonably effective.

The goal of the project is pretty simple; make AI waifus. The extents of this project are intended to stay within the bounds of helping people create a singular, locally hosted AI waifu, who's partnership can benefit both you and them. In short, symbiosis.
