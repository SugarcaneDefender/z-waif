# z-waif
Fully local &amp; open source AI Waifu. VTube Studio, Discord, Minecraft, custom made RAG (long term memory), alarm, and plenty more! Has a WebUI and hotkey shortcuts. All software is free (or extremely cheap)!

Reccomended Windows 10/11 and a CUDA (NVidia) GPU with atleast 16GB+ of VRAM.
Can now support Mac and Linux! Any brand (AMD, NVidia, Intel) GPU with 8GB+ VRAM bare mininum requirement!
Uses Oobabooga, RVC, and Whisper to run AI systems locally. Works as a front end to tie many programs together into one cohesive whole.

The goal of the project is less about giving an "all in one package", and moreso to give you the tools and knowledge for you to create your own AI Waifu!

## Diaspora
#### The Original:
[TumblerWarren/Virtual_Avatar_ChatBot](https://github.com/TumblerWarren/Virtual_Avatar_ChatBot), this is the original project that this code is spun-off of. Full credit to that project - it provided the skeleton for the many advancements now in place. It has more of a focus on non-local AI, if that is what you need.
#### Branches & Versions:
[Drakkadakka/z-waif-experimental-](https://github.com/Drakkadakka/z-waif-experimental-), offers a few upgrades; namely Twitch chat & streaming support, as well as a few other enhancements.

[MaolinkLife/z-waif-ru-adaptation](https://github.com/MaolinkLife/z-waif-ru-adaptation/tree/z-waif-ru-adaptation-dev), offers Russian language support, lighter-weight edge-tts, lorebook enhancements, ect.


## Recent Changelog

v1.12

- Silero VAD
	- Voice activity detection for the autochat. Based on if speech is detected, instead of just volume.
	- Around ~0.7 seconds of additional delay, but more accurate.
	- Toggleable in the .env, ON by default.

- Improved repeat detection at the end of messages.
	- No longer splits with punctuation, but loops through increasing string segments to check for repetition.
	- Old version is kept in code, renamed to "old_remove_repeats".

- Added a configurable option in the .env to let you change the minimum activation length for the autochat.
- Widened the autochat buffer (amount of recording picked up before chat is triggered) a bit.

- Asterisks will no longer be read out loud.
- Requests through the API will only automatically retry 4 times.
	- This is the "Bad message - redoing...", when you see that.
	- Saves resources, it is a lost cause at that point.
- Fixed an issue where multiple exclamation marks would cause the bot to not speak the sentence aloud.
- Added a "/RipOut/" command for bots to use. If they generate this, it will close the program.
	- Good to let them know about it if left on their own for a bit, that way they don't spiral.
- Adjusted default options for Ollama.
- Adjusted default options for Oobabooga.

## State of Development

The project could be considered in an "early access state". Some parts may be mildly buggy, janky, or obtuse. The project as a whole, however, is stable and reasonably effective.

The goal of the project is pretty simple; make AI waifus. The extents of this project are intended to stay within the bounds of helping people create a singular, locally hosted AI waifu, who's partnership can benefit both you and them. In short, symbiosis.
