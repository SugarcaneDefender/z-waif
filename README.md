# z-waif
Fully local &amp; open source AI Waifu. VTube Studio, Discord, Minecraft, custom made RAG (long term memory), alarm, and plenty more! Has a WebUI and hotkey shortcuts. All software is free (or extremely cheap)!

Reccomended Windows 10/11 and a CUDA (NVidia) GPU with atleast 16GB+ of VRAM.
Can now support Mac and Linux! Any brand (AMD, NVidia, Intel) GPU with 8GB+ VRAM bare mininum requirement!
Uses Oobabooga, RVC, and Whisper to run AI systems locally. Works as a front end to tie many programs together into one cohesive whole.

The goal of the project is less about giving an "all in one package", and moreso to give you the tools and knowledge for you to create your own AI Waifu!

## Diaspora
#### The Original:
[TumblerWarren/Virtual_Avatar_ChatBot](https://github.com/TumblerWarren/Virtual_Avatar_ChatBot), this is the original project that this code is spun-off of. Full credit to that project - it provided the skeleton for the many advancements now in place. It has more of a focus on non-local AI, if that is what you need.
#### Branches & Versions:
[Pre-Release Branch](https://github.com/SugarcaneDefender/z-waif/tree/pre-release), test the next update, all the new features and help prepare it before release!

[Drakkadakka/z-waif-experimental-](https://github.com/Drakkadakka/z-waif-experimental-), offers a few upgrades; namely Twitch chat & streaming support, as well as a few other enhancements.

[MaolinkLife/z-waif-ru-adaptation](https://github.com/MaolinkLife/z-waif-ru-adaptation/tree/z-waif-ru-adaptation-dev), offers Russian language support, lighter-weight edge-tts, lorebook enhancements, ect.


## Recent Changelog

	- Allows you to use a different API for your visual requests.
	- Mostly so you can use Oobabooga as the main, and Ollama as a visual assistant.

	- Small phrases said before saying their actual message, as the prompt evaluates.
	- Lowers perceived response time, and let you know that they are responding.
	- Only works with API_STREAM messages.
	- Configurable.

- Adjusted the RAG to be faster by storing fewer common words, and by tending to provide shorter memories.
- Updated requirements.
- Chat requests that come back blank now add in a " Hmm." at the end of the message.
	- This is to fix issues with streaming_lm and other issues where repeating the prompt causes soft failures.

## State of Development

The project could be considered in an "early access state". Some parts may be mildly buggy, janky, or obtuse. The project as a whole, however, is stable and reasonably effective.

The goal of the project is pretty simple; make AI waifus. The extents of this project are intended to stay within the bounds of helping people create a singular, locally hosted AI waifu, who's partnership can benefit both you and them. In short, symbiosis.
