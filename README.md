This is a test to show Drakka something

# z-waif
Fully local &amp; open source AI Waifu. VTube Studio, Discord, Minecraft, custom made RAG (long term memory), alarm, and plenty more! Has a WebUI and hotkey shortcuts. All software is free (or extremely cheap)!

Reccomended Windows 10/11 and a CUDA (NVidia) GPU with atleast 16GB+ of VRAM.
Can now support Mac and Linux! Any brand (AMD, NVidia, Intel) GPU with 8GB+ VRAM bare mininum requirement!
Uses Oobabooga, RVC, and Whisper to run AI systems locally. Works as a front end to tie many programs together into one cohesive whole.

The goal of the project is less about giving an "all in one package", and moreso to give you the tools and knowledge for you to create your own AI Waifu!

## Install & Links
Here is [some documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qzY09kcwfbZTaoJoQZDAWv282z88jeUCadivLnKDXCo/edit?usp=sharing) that you can look at. It will show you how to install, how to use the program, and what options you have. Please also take a look at the [Youtube videos for the install](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLH4bHuriW70RCl-2qHbSda8LHpuN8vvZZ).

If you need help / assistance, please submit a GitHub issue, or feel free to email me for this project at zwaif77@gmail.com

Z-Waif has [a basic website](https://zwaif.neocities.org/) that you can visit. I have also set up [a small Discord](https://discord.gg/XDWsAyVasH) for community members to chat as well.

### Running on Mac/Linux
Z-Waif supports both Mac and Linux using the ollama backend. You can clone the repo, then run the `./startup.sh` script. For more options, try `./startup.sh --help`. You need `glibc`, `portaudio`, `python3.11`, and `libglvnd` installed and on your PATH.

If you need support on Mac or Linux, ask around in the Discord. However you are expected to be able to solve basic problems (i.e. installing the right version of python) yourself.

For nix users, you can also use the nix flake to grab the os dependencies, then use the `startup.sh` script like usual.

## Diaspora
#### The Original:
[TumblerWarren/Virtual_Avatar_ChatBot](https://github.com/TumblerWarren/Virtual_Avatar_ChatBot), this is the original project that this code is spun-off of. Full credit to that project - it provided the skeleton for the many advancements now in place. It has more of a focus on non-local AI, if that is what you need.
#### Branches & Versions:
<!-- [Drakkadakka/z-waif-experimental-](https://github.com/Drakkadakka/z-waif-experimental-), offers a few upgrades; namely Twitch chat & streaming support, as well as a few other enhancements. -->

[MaolinkLife/z-waif-ru-adaptation](https://github.com/MaolinkLife/z-waif-ru-adaptation/tree/z-waif-ru-adaptation-dev), offers Russian language support, lighter-weight edge-tts, lorebook enhancements, ect.

## State of Development

The project could be considered in an "early access state". Some parts may be mildly buggy, janky, or obtuse. The project as a whole, however, is stable and reasonably effective.

The goal of the project is pretty simple; make AI waifus. The extents of this project are intended to stay within the bounds of helping people create a singular, locally hosted AI waifu, who's partnership can benefit both you and them. In short, symbiosis.
